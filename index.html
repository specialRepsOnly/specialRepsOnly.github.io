                This is for you, my Maddie. Meeting you was the best part of my 2024
Carrying that in 2025, till 18 is so magical! I am so glad we celebrated this special day together.. 7/1 is a beautiful date It's the same day the great Galelio discovered Saturn's 4 moons. 
7,1 both are prime numbers, and 1/7 forms a beautiful pattern of repeating decimals, which is one of the very few numbers possible. If you represent 7 in binary, it forms 111. So it's all mathematically connected
You, are beautiful human being, born on on a beautiful date. You are connected to the pure form of nature, and you resonate the beauty of being a true human, wether it's in your looks, intelligence,emotional reasoning or your personality.
You're a mix of so many divine attributes. You're also a fucking warrior. Even if life hasn't been easy sometimes, you've shown how STRONG you are, and you shall continue to be so! I take inspiration from you for that!
You,to me are a copy of God's divine spirit in the form of a human. You are my soul. This day, is only for you, my Maddie. Happy Birthday. I love you.
